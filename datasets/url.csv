“The issue at the heart of this case is whether, under current Board law, [Starbucks] was entitled to explicitly reward employees,” for not participating in union activity, “while falsely telling its workers that the federal labor law forced it to take this action,” wrote administrative law judge Mara-Louise Anzalone. “It was not.”","[{'span': 'Starbucks', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9354479312896729, 'char_start_index': 0, 'char_end_index': 9}, {'span': 'National Labor Relations Board', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9997506737709045, 'char_start_index': 127, 'char_end_index': 157}, {'span': 'Starbucks', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9736932516098022, 'char_start_index': 249, 'char_end_index': 258}, {'span': 'Mara-Louise Anzalone', 'label': 'PER', 'score': 0.9999368190765381, 'char_start_index': 645, 'char_end_index': 665}]",labor law,,The decision is the latest in a series of NLRB rulings finding that Starbucks has violated labor law in its efforts to stop unions from forming in coffee shops.

More people and companies in Russia have been hit by US sanctions in the last decade than any country other than Iran. Some, including business magnates and close political allies of Putin, are banned from doing business with US companies and individuals and making any transactions in dollars.

Despite the bounty on his head, he is linked to a number of businesses—including some that enjoy government contracts.

Over the past few years, the issue of refugees has become highly politicised. Refugees are seen either as victims or aggressors to be kept out. Yet there are groups of refugees who have trumped the odds. In this series, we feature an earlier wave of refugees who haven’t just survived, but are thriving today and giving back to their communities. Our culinary heroes originated from every part of Asia and fanned out across the globe in search of new lives. Today, they are using food in powerful ways and reshaping the way people see Asia. Behind each dish is a story of survival - stories of refugees who seek freedom from societies in conflict, of people who struggle to build new lives with treasured family recipes, and cities that have been enriched by their presence. This series proves that food can truly break down walls, and help us find the commonality across different people.","[{'span': 'Javad Ghaderi', 'label': 'PER', 'score': 0.9993558526039124, 'char_start_index': 14, 'char_end_index': 27}, {'span': 'Wollongong', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9999673366546631, 'char_start_index': 277, 'char_end_index': 287}, {'span': 'Australia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.999909520149231, 'char_start_index': 289, 'char_end_index': 298}, {'span': 'Asia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9995507597923279, 'char_start_index': 715, 'char_end_index': 719}, {'span': 'Asia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9965344667434692, 'char_start_index': 853, 'char_end_index': 857}]",family law,Australia,"Javad Ghaderi kept his Afghan nationality a secret for 28 years.

According to a video posted by Ms Li Qiushuang, her parents went to work in Fujian province over 20 years ago. Every year before the Spring Festival, they would return to Chongqing together.

However in 2024, due to her grandmother’s illness, Ms Li’s father returned to their home town early, leaving her mother alone in Jinjiang, Fujian, where she works at a shoe factory.

Over a video call, Ms Li’s mother told her daughter that she would not be coming home for the festive period this year.

The trishaw evolved from the rickshaw – a small, two-wheeled cart pulled by a man. 

Originating from Japan, rickshaws were first seen in Singapore in the 1880s. They were one of the earliest modes of transport in Singapore, alongside steam trams and bullock carts.

Rickshaw rides were inexpensive and ideal for short journeys through crowded inner-city streets.

The first trishaws were officially registered in Singapore in 1914, according to Roots, a website by the National Heritage Board (NHB). Known as “pedal rickshaws”, these early trishaws were essentially modified rickshaws attached to bicycles. 

But the initial batch of 15 trishaws was said to be “crudely constructed” and did not last long on Singapore’s streets, according to the National Library Board’s (NLB) Infopedia website.","[{'span': 'Japan', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9999004602432251, 'char_start_index': 143, 'char_end_index': 148}, {'span': 'Singapore', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9999262094497681, 'char_start_index': 179, 'char_end_index': 188}, {'span': 'Singapore', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9998983144760132, 'char_start_index': 255, 'char_end_index': 264}, {'span': 'Singapore', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9995163679122925, 'char_start_index': 455, 'char_end_index': 464}, {'span': 'Roots', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8255846500396729, 'char_start_index': 487, 'char_end_index': 492}, {'span': 'National Heritage Board', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9976503252983093, 'char_start_index': 511, 'char_end_index': 534}, {'span': 'Singapore', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9806447625160217, 'char_start_index': 750, 'char_end_index': 759}, {'span': 'National Library Board', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7346915602684021, 'char_start_index': 788, 'char_end_index': 810}]",criminal law,Japan,"The trishaw evolved from the rickshaw, a small, two-wheeled cart pulled by a man.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/betta-fish,"Habitat
Betta fish originated from Thailand but can be found in nearby countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Wild bettas live in shallow, freshwater areas such as rice paddies, stagnant ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Being used to Asian climates, they prefer warm water around 80º Fahrenheit. Colder water can cause them to become lethargic, stop eating, or become more prone to disease or infection. Their diet mainly consists of plankton, crustaceans, and larvae.

Because their usual habitats are extremely low in oxygen, bettas have evolved to breathe air at the water’s surface. This ability develops over time: hatchlings rely on their gills, but adults gulp air and capture the oxygen from it using something called a labyrinth organ, which is attached to the gills and functions similarly to a human lung.","[{'span': 'Thailand', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.99978107213974, 'char_start_index': 35, 'char_end_index': 43}, {'span': 'Malaysia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9999403953552246, 'char_start_index': 89, 'char_end_index': 97}, {'span': 'Indonesia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9999411106109619, 'char_start_index': 99, 'char_end_index': 108}, {'span': 'Vietnam', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9999388456344604, 'char_start_index': 110, 'char_end_index': 117}, {'span': 'Laos', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9999401569366455, 'char_start_index': 119, 'char_end_index': 123}, {'span': 'Cambodia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9999358654022217, 'char_start_index': 129, 'char_end_index': 137}]",environmental law,Thailand,"Betta fish originated from Thailand but can be found in nearby countries.

The drink is often known as flaming Spanish coffee due to its use of rum in large portions, which allows it to be lit by fire.

They were discovered on China’s Chengdu Plain, at an archeological dig site called Sanxingdui (which translates as “three star mound”).

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bamboo-mathematicians,"In the late 1960s, a species of bamboo called Phyllostachys bambusoides–commonly known as the Chinese Mainland Bamboo or Japanese Timber Bamboo–burst into flower. The species originated in China, was introduced to Japan, and later into the United States and other countries. And when I say it flowered, I mean it flowered everywhere. Forests of the plant burst into bloom in synchrony, despite being separated by thousands of miles. If, like me, you missed it, you will probably not live to see it happen again. The flowers released pollen into the wind, and the fertilized plants then produced seeds that fell to the ground. The magnificent bamboo plants, which can grow 72 feet tall, then all promptly died. Their seeds later sprouted and sent up new plants. The new generation is now close to fifty years old and has yet to grow a single flower.

At the time, his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent, “the first among equals.” His ascension continued smoothly until 2005. That year, Lachlan abruptly quit his executive positions at News Corporation after a battle with Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan then launched his own investment company, Illyria Pty, in Australia. After an extended absence, Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 and resumed his position as a potential heir to the empire, becoming CEO of Fox Broadcasting and executive chairman at 21st Century Fox. Shortly after, Lachlan’s younger brother James was tapped to be CEO of 21st Century Fox in a power-sharing experiment orchestrated by Rupert between the brothers. The experiment proved unsuccessful, and Rupert sold 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019.

To put it simply, senescence refers to the phenomenon of cell ageing, in which cells age and stop dividing. This decreased ability to renew and repair can result in the appearance of ageing signs such as wrinkles, loss of skin elasticity, and changes in skin texture.

Chanel has been studying senescence for years; it is at the heart of its skin ageing research.

Russia enjoys a “privileged strategic partnership” with India. The relationship has strong historical roots, dating back to non-aligned India’s shared anti-colonial sentiment with the Soviet Union. India has carefully avoided taking sides in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Russia has long been New Delhi’s main arms supplier. While India’s weapons sources are becoming more diverse, it still needs Russian logistical support to maintain its existing weapons inventory.

India is a major oil importer, and rapid economic growth is driving increased demand. In the past year, India has massively increased purchases of cheap Russian oil.

India values close, stable relations with Russia as a strategic hedge against China, its main rival.

Barack Obama is set to become the first sitting US president to visit Havana for nearly 90 years when he goes there later this month.

The signing in the capital was the culmination of quiet discussions taking place in the background while attention was focussed on Cuba's new ties with Washington.

Somaliland and Taiwan established diplomatic relations last year to the fury of those neighbours.

Somalia denounced Taiwan for becoming friends with Somaliland. Chinese officials travelled to Somaliland and insisted it sever ties with Taiwan.

It is possible that China sees Taiwan's relationship with Somaliland as a potential disruptor of its Belt and Road Initiative, whereby it plans to develop sea and land trade routes across Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

An obstructive Somaliland, with its highly strategic Berbera port, could block the continuity of its Maritime Silk Road along the eastern coast of Africa.","[{'span': 'China', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9997636675834656, 'char_start_index': 9, 'char_end_index': 14}, {'span': 'Somalia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9996665716171265, 'char_start_index': 19, 'char_end_index': 26}, {'span': 'Somalia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9999569654464722, 'char_start_index': 99, 'char_end_index': 106}, {'span': 'China', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9998201727867126, 'char_start_index': 111, 'char_end_index': 116}, {'span': 'Somaliland', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9997804760932922, 'char_start_index': 169, 'char_end_index': 179}, {'span': 'Taiwan', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9998866319656372, 'char_start_index': 184, 'char_end_index': 190}, {'span': 'Somalia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9986042380332947, 'char_start_index': 268, 'char_end_index': 275}, {'span': 'Taiwan', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9974160194396973, 'char_start_index': 286, 'char_end_index': 292}, {'span': 'Somaliland', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.936347484588623, 'char_start_index': 319, 'char_end_index': 329}, {'span': 'Somaliland', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.968851625919342, 'char_start_index': 362, 'char_end_index': 372}, {'span': 'Taiwan', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9944964051246643, 'char_start_index': 405, 'char_end_index': 411}, {'span': 'China', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.8180795907974243, 'char_start_index': 434, 'char_end_index': 439}, {'span': 'Taiwan', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.8986895084381104, 'char_start_index': 445, 'char_end_index': 451}, {'span': 'Somaliland', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9421939253807068, 'char_start_index': 472, 'char_end_index': 482}, {'span': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7952298521995544, 'char_start_index': 515, 'char_end_index': 539}, {'span': 'Asia', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.999713122844696, 'char_start_index': 602, 'char_end_index': 606}, {'span': 'Middle East', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9996517896652222, 'char_start_index': 612, 'char_end_index': 623}, {'span': 'Africa', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9993662238121033, 'char_start_index': 628, 'char_end_index': 634}, {'span': 'Somaliland', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.7729796767234802, 'char_start_index': 652, 'char_end_index': 662}, {'span': 'Berbera', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.43317657709121704, 'char_start_index': 690, 'char_end_index': 697}, {'span': 'Maritime Silk Road', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.990281343460083, 'char_start_index': 738, 'char_end_index': 756}, {'span': 'Africa', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9973242282867432, 'char_start_index': 784, 'char_end_index': 790}]",criminal law,China,Somaliland and Taiwan established diplomatic relations last year.
