In his/her interviews conducted on 31st August and 14th September 2004, Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 Representative admitted that the fact that both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 took part together in three Airport tenders put other competitors at a disadvantage, but alleged both companies have never exchanged information with regard to the price offers.

There were doubts whether both companies Vendor 3 and Vendor 4 exist and submitted bids for the three tenders. The ITF investigation, with support from the Kosovo Organised Crime Bureau (KOCB), has found no reference with regard to the existence of the alleged competitor Vendor 4 in Pristina. The alleged company Vendor 3 was found to be a supermarket located in Prizren.

The above-mentioned facts are already part of the ITF case no. 286/04 that was submitted to the International Prosecutor, UNMIK Department of Justice, in October 2004.

10.pdf,"""Allegation 4:

(Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own test results to confirm the quality of its own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflict of interest.)

An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 to the Procurement Official, signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, indicates that DOTI Official 1 authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memorandum also adds that the work was inadvertently not included in the original contract.

DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to progress the cargo apron tender, he/she had to organise a geographical survey.

Accordingly, METI has pushed three principles: technical development, energy conservation and nuclear energy, and participation of all countries in the future framework. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) apparently wants Abe to mention at the bilateral summit Japan's goal of reducing carbon emissions by half by 2050 as part of the ""Abe initiative,"" which will be announced in late May. The MFA was considering not informing the U.S. in advance of its intention, because the ministry did not expect Washington to approve of such a goal, based on the U.S. reaction to climate change issues so far. It was apparently decided at a briefing at the Prime Minister's official residence that Abe will clearly state the goal at the bilateral summit, with advance notification to the United States.

Approach (TS//SI//NF)

(TS//SI//NF) Japanese climate change officials apparently plan to continue promoting the sectoral approach despite criticism from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and some European Union officials. Fatih Birol, Chief Economist of the IEA, reportedly warned the Japanese in mid­-May that they are pushing too hard to promote the sectoral approach and may be perceived as offering this approach as the only option for reducing carbon emissions. He also cautioned that the sectoral approach is not yet understood and that Tokyo must clarify the concept and promote understanding and trust among the nations concerned. Masakazu Toyoda of the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry expressed frustration at this criticism then laid out three advantages of the sectoral approach: first, the approach is designed to get China, India, and the U.S. on board; second, this approach allows developed countries to avoid expending unnecessary efforts to reduce carbon emissions in areas covered by the sectoral approach; and third, the sectoral approach will, in Toyoda's estimation, not result in any economic or industrial loss for developed or developing nations. One Japanese official thinks that it may be difficult for the Europeans to implement the sectoral approach in sectors such as electricity, which is already subject to the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). He suggested that the ultimate solution is dependent upon the EU accepting a method of determining a figure for total carbon emissions reductions that includes the electricity sector.

108.pdf,"""Japanese Strive to Avoid Damage to U.S. Relations Over Cherry Imports (TS//SI//OC/NF)

(TS//SI//OC/NF) Officials in the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) appeared recently to be seeking ways to prevent damage to relations with the U.S. over the ministry's decision to delay the importation of U.S.-­origin cherries, a decision driven by Japanese politicians and growers. MAFF was alarmed by the very strong reaction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Tokyo's ruling that imports could not commence until the end of this month, when a pilot program involving inspections in the U.S. Pacific Northwest by a MAFF inspector is expected to be concluded satisfactorily. One approach under consideration is to have the ministry admit to Washington, through back channels, that the decision had been the product of political pressure. Also, it was recommended that the U.S. be notified that­­unlike in the beef dispute­­imports could begin as soon as the result of on­site inspection is confirmed, rather than after the inspector had returned to Japan and more tests conducted. The principal fear among the Japanese is that the issue will become similarly politicized, possibly at senior levels, in Washington.

110.pdf,"The EU and Japan were engaged as of early December in strategy sessions aimed at a common handling policy to deal with potential U.S. moves in the Doha Round negotiations. There was a conviction in both Brussels and Tokyo, according to Japanese reporting, that great care must be taken to avoid falling prey to U.S. moves designed to extort concessions through exaggerated initial demands. Regarding U.S. domestic supports for agriculture, for example, Japanese Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Toshikatsu Matsuoka and EU Agriculture Commissioner Marianne Fischer-Boel recently pondered whether to jump-start the negotiations by asking the U.S. for a specific dollar figure in reduced supports. The problem for the EU, it was noted, is whether or not the proposed $17 billion mark is an acceptable point of departure, since U.S. supports at that level are judged to be in no way comparable to the breadth of market access that Brussels put on the table last July. A figure of $14 to $15 billion would be more in line with the EU's thinking, Fischer-Boel indicated. The EU also had concerns that Washington may be headed for a showdown with developing countries over special products. As for sensitive products, Fischer-Boel's deputy chef de cabinet, Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, hinted to the Japanese that the EU may be willing to go lower than its current official limit of 8 percent, possibly as low as 4 to 5 percent; however, that would be hard for Japan to accept. Borchardt also tried to allay Japanese fears that the EU might try again to enter into a bilateral, under-the-table deal with the U.S. (as had happened in Cancun in 2003), saying that Brussels had learned its lesson with respect to such back-door actions.",the eu and japan were engaged as of early december in strategy sessions aimed at a common handling policy to deal with potential u s moves in the doha round negotiations there was a conviction in both brussels and tokyo according to japanese reporting that great care must be taken to avoid falling prey to u s moves designed to extort concessions through exaggerated initial demands regarding u s domestic supports for agriculture for example japanese minister of agriculture forestry and fisheries toshikatsu matsuoka and eu agriculture commissioner marianne fischer boel recently pondered whether to jump start the negotiations by asking the u s for a specific dollar figure in reduced supports the problem for the eu it was noted is whether or not the proposed billion mark is an acceptable point of departure since u s supports at that level are judged to be in no way comparable to the breadth of market access that brussels put on the table last july a figure of to billion would be more in line with the eu's thinking fischer boel indicated the eu also had concerns that washington may be headed for a showdown with developing countries over special products as for sensitive products fischer boel's deputy chef de cabinet klaus dieter borchardt hinted to the japanese that the eu may be willing to go lower than its current official limit of percent possibly as low as to percent ; however that would be hard for japan to accept borchardt also tried to allay japanese fears that the eu might try again to enter into a bilateral under the table deal with the u s (as had happened in cancun in ) saying that brussels had learned its lesson with respect to such back door actions,eu japan engaged early december strategy session aimed common handling policy deal potential u move doha round negotiation wa conviction brussels tokyo according japanese reporting great care must taken avoid falling prey u move designed extort concession exaggerated initial demand regarding u domestic support agriculture example japanese minister agriculture forestry fishery toshikatsu matsuoka eu agriculture commissioner marianne fischer boel recently pondered whether jump start negotiation asking u specific dollar figure reduced support problem eu wa noted whether proposed billion mark acceptable point departure since u support level judged way comparable breadth market access brussels put table last july figure billion would line eu 's thinking fischer boel indicated eu also concern washington may headed showdown developing country special product sensitive product fischer boel 's deputy chef de cabinet klaus dieter borchardt hinted japanese eu may willing go lower current official limit percent possibly low percent ; however would hard japan accept borchardt also tried allay japanese fear eu might try enter bilateral table deal u happened cancun saying brussels learned lesson respect back door action,"[{'span': 'EU', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9892719984054565, 'char_start_index': 4, 'char_end_index': 6}, {'span': 'Japan', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.8777908086776733, 'char_start_index': 11, 'char_end_index': 16}, {'span': 'Doha Round negotiations', 'label': 'MEDIA', 'score': 0.687521755695343, 'char_start_index': 147, 'char_end_index': 170}, {'span': 'Brussels', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.999313235282898, 'char_start_index': 203, 'char_end_index': 211}, {'span': 'Tokyo', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9997095465660095, 'char_start_index': 216, 'char_end_index': 221}, {'span': 'Toshikatsu Matsuoka', 'label': 'PER', 'score': 0.9857379198074341, 'char_start_index': 511, 'char_end_index': 530}, {'span': 'Marianne Fischer-Boel', 'label': 'PER', 'score': 0.9997963309288025, 'char_start_index': 563, 'char_end_index': 584}, {'span': 'EU', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.827061116695404, 'char_start_index': 731, 'char_end_index': 733}, {'span': 'Fischer-Boel', 'label': 'PER', 'score': 0.49881500005722046, 'char_start_index': 1057, 'char_end_index': 1069}, {'span': 'EU', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6119487285614014, 'char_start_index': 1085, 'char_end_index': 1087}, {'span': 'Washington', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9900645613670349, 'char_start_index': 1111, 'char_end_index': 1121}]"

112.pdf,"Israel has reached out to Europe, including Italy, for help in smoothing out the current rift in its relations with the United States, according to Italian diplomatic reporting of 13 March. Speaking with Italian Prime Minister (PM) Silvio Berlusconi, Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu insisted that the trigger for the dispute--Israel's decision to build 1,600 homes in contested East Jerusalem--was totally in keeping with national policy dating back to the administration of Golda Meir, and blamed this mishandling on a government official with poor political sensitivity. The objective now, Netanyahu said, is to keep the Palestinians from using this issue as a pretext to block a resumption of talks or to advance unrealistic claims that could risk sinking the peace negotiations altogether.

In that regard, Ban considered the Poznan Conference to be very important as a ""bridge"" toward Copenhagen.

24.pdf,"""During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that on 26 January 2003, an anonymous person, using the identities of “Hiwot Abebe” sent an email to the President and Vice-President of the United States of America. The email was also addressed to Senator John Kerry and Senator Dodd of the United States Senate. The email had an attachment that was addressed to the Executive Secretary of ECA and highlighted allegations of sexual harassment and rape perpetrated by some senior officials of ECA within the ECA Complex. The title to the attachment was “Crimes of Rape and Maladministration within the compound of ECA”. The document was also copied to the Secretary-General, Ethiopian Foreign Ministry and senior officials in the UN System.

The Investigation Task Force (ITF) has been investigating an allegation regarding administrative irregularities regarding the insurance coverage for Pristina Airport by a London-based Company, who then purchased the cover from Insurance Company 1 between 2001 and 2003.

Based on extensive documentation obtained from UNMIK Pillar II, the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Public Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP), the ITF determined that the responsible Manager did not undertake efforts in 2002 or 2003 to invite international tenders for the Airport’s insurance coverage. According to UNMIK regulations 1999/2 – Finance Administration Instruction on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Funds – and in view of the cost of the premiums of more than $125,000 USD, such a tender should have been undertaken.

Procurement Officer 1 explained to the ITF that the original nominee to the committee, Committee member 1, had not been at work on the day that the committee first convened and, therefore, had been replaced by Committee member 2, who then attended the second session for continuity purposes. Committee member 1 and Committee member 2 confirmed Procurement Officer 1’s explanation for the replacement.
Allegation 3: that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately included the Finance Officer in the Bid Evaluation Committee

The Finance Officer, Procurement Officer 1, and Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that the Finance Officer participated on the Bid Evaluation Committee. However, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official each said that the other had nominated the Finance Officer to the committee.
KTA legal staff advised the ITF that the wisdom of allowing a representative of the Finance Department to participate in bid evaluations is questionable because, generally, officers whose function involves payment should not evaluate contractors to whom payment will become due. According to KTA legal staff, however, such participation is not precluded by any rule or law. Section 23.9.2 of Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revised 15 December 1999) – Public Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds precludes only an “approving officer” from the Procuring Entity who will eventually sign a contract from serving as a tender evaluator.

Although PEAP Official as the responsible official at that time denied that he/she had requested Vendor 2 Representative support for the FIDS supply and cabling procurements, Vendor 2 Representative granted the ITF that he/she acted on PEAP Official’s request.

Nevertheless, PEAP official bears the overall responsibility for his/her department (PEAP), and this investigation proved again that he/she did not fully meet the requirements as manager in a sensitive area like the Airport.

The entire matter has to be seen as an administrative irregularity. It is obvious that international procurement rules had been breached but the Procurement Regulation that was in force at that
time - Financial Agreement 1999/2 - does not indicate cases like described before.

An official of a non-Airport related company, supported the procurement process for the supply of the Flat Information Display System (FIDS) by writing the recommendation and justification for a Single source procurement and also defined the technical specifications. As Vendor 1 was only able to supply but not to cable the FIDS, another tender had to be launched for the FIDS cabling. Winner of this tender was Vendor 2.

Background Information

The Single Source Procurement (Purchase and supply of FIDS) started on 17 October 2002 with a written recommendation and justification by Vendor 2 Representative. The purchase of additional FIDS became necessary because of the expansion of the Passenger Terminal Building. The already existing system had been provided by Vendor 1, therefore the Airport Management decided to choose Vendor 1 again.

The Capital Expenditure Approval and contract were signed on 13 December 2002. The procurement file does not show why Vendor 1 only delivered the FIDS but did not cable it.

There is no evidence that the Airline have sought to avoid any charges levied by Pristina Airport. All charges levied upon the Airline by Pristina Airport for incoming and outgoing flights have been paid and receipts issued. The charges applied to the Airline flights are in accordance with listed charges for services.

The identification of the flight as ""humanitarian"" is a matter for closer review by Airport Pristina management to ensure compliance with airport charges.

The information as to a credit arrangement for the Airline was also provided to the Pristina Airport Senior Official by the ITF for his/her action.

Analysis of the note written by the PEAP Official suggests that the company referred to in his note as “escavator” is in fact Company 1, who won the contract for the construction of the new car park at Pristina Airport and whose representative attended a meeting in the PEAP Official’s office one day prior to the discovery of the money.

The sum of €5,200 alleged to have been left in the envelope is unusual, since one would expect the sum to have been a “round sum” such as €5000.

It should be noted that an interoffice memorandum from a former Airport Engineer to the KTA Procurement Specialist, dated 26 September 2002, alleged that the PEAP Official had accepted an open envelope of documents relating to the car park tender from Company 2, after the time for submission of bids had concluded and contrary to accepted procurement procedures on the handling of bids.

This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV, which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.

Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from a member state’s armed forces specifically Airport Engineer I, Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm

On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him/her were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.

On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR, was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations.

On the 16th of March 2004, Partner 1 paid the €8,000.00 to the Company Representative, who then went to Pristina Airport to hand it to Official 1. The Company Representative stated that the hand-over of the cash to Official 1 took place outside the airport terminal gate. The Airport X-Ray Operator, who observed the meeting between the two men, corroborated the fact that the meeting took place as stated.

ITF Investigators visited the Cargo Department Finance Office to check official documentation in relation to the Company merchandise. No trace of the payment of the €8,000 could be found in the Cargo Department account books for 2003 or 2004.

According to the tariff list that the Finance Officer of the Cargo Section provided to the ITF, the Company should have paid an amount of approximately €32,000.00 for storage fees from the 23rd of December 2003 to 15th of March 2004.""",iii investigative details on the th of march partner paid the to the company representative who then went to pristina airport to hand it to official the company representative stated that the hand over of the cash to official took place outside the airport terminal gate the airport x ray operator who observed the meeting between the two men corroborated the fact that the meeting took place as stated itf investigators visited the cargo department finance office to check official documentation in relation to the company merchandise no trace of the payment of the could be found in the cargo department account books for or according to the tariff list that the finance officer of the cargo section provided to the itf the company should have paid an amount of approximately for storage fees from the rd of december to th of march,iii investigative detail th march partner paid company representative went pristina airport hand official company representative stated hand cash official took place outside airport terminal gate airport x ray operator observed meeting two men corroborated fact meeting took place stated itf investigator visited cargo department finance office check official documentation relation company merchandise trace payment could found cargo department account book according tariff list finance officer cargo section provided itf company paid amount approximately storage fee rd december th march,"[{'span': 'Pristina Airport', 'label': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9998993873596191, 'char_start_index': 133, 'char_end_index': 149}, {'span': 'Airport X-Ray Operator', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9421303272247314, 'char_start_index': 305, 'char_end_index': 327}, {'span': 'Cargo Department Finance Office', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9893218278884888, 'char_start_index': 467, 'char_end_index': 498}, {'span': 'Cargo Department', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6655480861663818, 'char_start_index': 631, 'char_end_index': 647}]"

ITF Investigators met with the Company Representative, who explained that a part of his business involves the importation and marketing of LED display equipment. The Company consists of 4 partners:
• Partner 1
• Partner 2
• Partner 3
• Partner 4

The above company partners agreed to the following regarding the various payments to be effected as follows:
• Partner 2 and Partner 3 were to pay the total price of all the goods;
• Partner 1 was to pay everything regarding VAT, Custom Duties, Local Taxes and Storage.

III. THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF AIRPORT PRISTINA CARGO OFFICIALS

It was Official 2’s responsibility to ensure that storage fees were paid and a record of the payments be kept. The procedure for recording payments is that the airway bill with a customs stamp should have been provided to the Finance Officer whereby he/she then calculates the storage fees owed. Before individuals or companies were allowed to retrieve their goods, this fee had to be paid pursuant to an official invoice. In this instant case, there is no record of such an invoice or any such payment. The absence of such a record is highly unusual and establishes that monies owed to the airport were not received in this case.

Official 1 worked in the Cargo Handling Office at the Airport. As with Official 2, it was Official 1’s duty to ensure that all payments made by customers of the airport complied with the applicable regulations and instructions.""",ii background itf investigators met with the company representative who explained that a part of his business involves the importation and marketing of led display equipment the company consists of partners partner partner partner partner the above company partners agreed to the following regarding the various payments to be effected as follows partner and partner were to pay the total price of all the goods ; partner was to pay everything regarding vat custom duties local taxes and storage iii the duties and responsibilities of airport pristina cargo officials it was official s responsibility to ensure that storage fees were paid and a record of the payments be kept the procedure for recording payments is that the airway bill with a customs stamp should have been provided to the finance officer whereby heshe then calculates the storage fees owed before individuals or companies were allowed to retrieve their goods this fee had to be paid pursuant to an official invoice in this instant case there is no record of such an invoice or any such payment the absence of such a record is highly unusual and establishes that monies owed to the airport were not received in this case official worked in the cargo handling office at the airport as with official it was official s duty to ensure that all payments made by customers of the airport complied with the applicable regulations and instructions,ii background itf investigator met company representative explained part business involves importation marketing led display equipment company consists partner partner partner partner partner company partner agreed following regarding various payment effected follows partner partner pay total price good ; partner wa pay everything regarding vat custom duty local tax storage iii duty responsibility airport pristina cargo official wa official responsibility ensure storage fee paid record payment kept procedure recording payment airway bill custom stamp provided finance officer whereby heshe calculates storage fee owed individual company allowed retrieve good fee paid pursuant official invoice instant case record invoice payment absence record highly unusual establishes monies owed airport received case official worked cargo handling office airport official wa official duty ensure payment made customer airport complied applicable regulation instruction,[]

This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV, which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.

Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer 1, Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3 and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm.

On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.

On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations.

An invitation to bid followed on April 15, 2002 which was transmitted to 36 vendors from nine countries. CITS advised PD that they desired only “IBM, Dell and Compaq” based on ITSD standards for desktop computers. On the other hand, PD and the Information Technology Services Division (ITSD), involved in the process by Mr. Bahel, recommended adding Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and NEC to the list. In a subsequent exchange of emails between PD and the requisitioner (CITS and ITSD), CITS continued to assert that they sought only the three major brands of computers to avoid “inferior products,” laptops from “questionable manufacturers,” “clones” and “home built computers.” Ultimately, however, CITS agreed that they were amenable to expanding the field to include other major brands of computer manufacturers who were recognized industry leaders. As a result, on April 24, 2002, the case officer, Mr. Cabrera, issued a bid amendment notification to the vendors correcting the anticipated quantity of the computers sought, and clarifying that that only “Compaq, Dell, IBM, Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and NEC” brands would be considered for solicitation.",in february dpko communications and technology services division (cits) sought to obtain a new systems contract for laptop computers mr cabrera was the procurement officer in the procurement department (pd) assigned to this matter the chief of cits communicated his request to pd and on february an expression of interest was issued by pd an invitation to bid followed on april which was transmitted to vendors from nine countries cits advised pd that they desired only ibm dell and compaq based on itsd standards for desktop computers on the other hand pd and the information technology services division (itsd) involved in the process by mr bahel recommended adding toshiba sony fujitsu and nec to the list in a subsequent exchange of emails between pd and the requisitioner (cits and itsd) cits continued to assert that they sought only the three major brands of computers to avoid inferior products laptops from questionable manufacturers clones and home built computers ultimately however cits agreed that they were amenable to expanding the field to include other major brands of computer manufacturers who were recognized industry leaders as a result on april the case officer mr cabrera issued a bid amendment notification to the vendors correcting the anticipated quantity of the computers sought and clarifying that that only compaq dell ibm toshiba sony fujitsu and nec brands would be considered for solicitation,february dpko communication technology service division cits sought obtain new system contract laptop computer mr cabrera wa procurement officer procurement department pd assigned matter chief cits communicated request pd february expression interest wa issued pd invitation bid followed april wa transmitted vendor nine country cits advised pd desired ibm dell compaq based itsd standard desktop computer hand pd information technology service division itsd involved process mr bahel recommended adding toshiba sony fujitsu nec list subsequent exchange email pd requisitioner cits itsd cits continued assert sought three major brand computer avoid inferior product laptop questionable manufacturer clone home built computer ultimately however cits agreed amenable expanding field include major brand computer manufacturer recognized industry leader result april case officer mr cabrera issued bid amendment notification vendor correcting anticipated quantity computer sought clarifying compaq dell ibm toshiba sony fujitsu nec brand would considered solicitation,"[{'span': 'DPKO Communications and Technology Services Division', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9955257773399353, 'char_start_index': 19, 'char_end_index': 71}, {'span': 'IBM', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9991336464881897, 'char_start_index': 505, 'char_end_index': 508}, {'span': 'Dell', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9995922446250916, 'char_start_index': 510, 'char_end_index': 514}, {'span': 'Compaq', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9987027645111084, 'char_start_index': 519, 'char_end_index': 525}, {'span': 'Information Technology Services Division', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9648069739341736, 'char_start_index': 604, 'char_end_index': 644}, {'span': 'Toshiba', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9997149109840393, 'char_start_index': 710, 'char_end_index': 717}, {'span': 'Sony', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9996774196624756, 'char_start_index': 719, 'char_end_index': 723}, {'span': 'Fujitsu', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9997085928916931, 'char_start_index': 725, 'char_end_index': 732}, {'span': 'NEC', 'label': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9998316764831543, 'char_start_index': 737, 'char_end_index': 740}]"

82.pdf,"The purpose of this report is to address the matters raised in the audit findings of January 2006 concerning Walter Cabrera, a United Nations procurement officer, and another matter brought to the attention of the Task Force through a separate referral. First, Mr. Cabrera is alleged to have improperly provided notification to a prospective vendor that approval had been granted in favor of the vendor, Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird) for a contract to provide manpower support in UN Missions, prior to the official award of the contract. Secondly, the audit report found that Cabrera engaged in misconduct in connection with the procurement exercises in substantial contracts ultimately awarded to the firm Telecommunications Consultants of India (TCIL).

Indeed, no justification is provided to La Cresta, or found in the file. It seems that La Cresta was not formally informed of the cancellation.

In this case, there is no correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying them of the cancellation. A DPKO official involved in the process has informed the Task Force that in conversations with PD in this interim period, it was represented to him that PD had expressed a view that there was an “issue” with LaCresta’s submission. According to the official, the Procurement Department suggested a re-bid because of a “technicality.” While the official objected, he was told that because the matter is a commercial one it is only within PD’s prerogative to cancel the bid on the basis of commercial non-compliance. This explanation is not persuasive as there was no commercial or technical issue with LaCresta’s bid. DPKO had found La Cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder.

89.pdf,"""Sensitive Issues on the Agenda When French, U.S. Presidents Meet Next Week in Washington (TS//SI//NF)

(TS//SI//NF) French President Sarkozy intends to raise a number of sensitive topics with the U.S. President when the two leaders meet in Washington on 31 March, according to an exchange last week between the French ambassador in Washington Pierre Vimont, and Sarkozy's diplomatic advisor, Jean-David Levitte.
